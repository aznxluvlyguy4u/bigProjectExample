FERTILIZER ACCOUNTING NOTE: The fixed excretion standards that are included in this report are based on Table 4 Animal-related flat-rate levels %year% RVO. Do you have a biological company that is registered with the Skal Foundation and do you keep grazing animals? Other nitrogen excretion levels may then apply (see excretory levels for nitrogen from the appendix to the Animal Products Regulation). For the calculation of phosphate excretion, you can use the figures in this report.
